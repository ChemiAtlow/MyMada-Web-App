# MyMada Web Version (PWA) ðŸš‘ðŸ•¸

## My Mada
The ["MyMada" app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atlow.chemi.mymada) was built solely for the use of MADA volunteers.

Its purpose was to facilitate easy contact with the MADA dispatch, and turn reception of emergency calls more convenient and noticeable.

The app was only available for Android phones, and therefore the PWA was first created at September 2019, with all functionallities that did not require any Android OS permissions.

## First version
The previous version started out with Vanilla JS, using [Materialize.css](https://materializecss.com/) and jQuery.

## Current version
The current version was built using Vue.JS framework, and has all the features the first version had, built as an SPA, working and loading much faster, and much more efficiently.

## running version
A running version is available at [MyMada](https://chemiatlow.github.io/MyMada-Web-App).
